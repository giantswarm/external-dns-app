# external-dns-app chart

Helm chart for the [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) service running in Workload
Clusters. This chart is used to deploy both as a default app and as a Managed App.
It can be installed multiple times in the same Workload Cluster.

**What is this App?**

`external-dns` makes Kubernetes resources discoverable via external DNS servers. It dynamically configures external DNS providers ([AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/), [Azure DNS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/)) for Kubernetes Ingresses, Services etc.

**Why did we add it?**

The App is already used as a default App in most clusters (except on-prem) to provide DNS records for [nginx-ingress-controller-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app).

**Who can use it?**

Customers using Giant Swarm clusters on AWS or Azure.

## Installing

There are 3 ways to install this app onto a workload cluster:

1. [Using our web interface](https://docs.giantswarm.io/reference/web-interface/app-catalog/)
2. [Using our API](https://docs.giantswarm.io/api/#operation/createClusterAppV5)
3. Directly creating the [App custom resource](https://docs.giantswarm.io/use-the-api/management-api/crd/apps.application.giantswarm.io/) on the Management Cluster

## Configuring

Configuration options are documented in the [Configuration.md](https://github.com/giantswarm/external-dns-app/blob/master/helm/external-dns-app/Configuration.md)
document. See also the [default `values.yaml`](https://github.com/giantswarm/external-dns-app/blob/master/helm/external-dns-app/values.yaml)

### values.yaml

This is an example of a values file you could upload using our web interface. It assumes:

- The cloud provider is AWS.
- API access is internal and therefore authentication is provided by KIAM.
- Only Ingress resources in the namespace `web-app` should be reconciled.
- Only Hosted Zone `Z262CGXUQ3M97` will be modified.

```yaml
# values.yaml
aws:
  iam:
    customRoleName: 'my-precreated-route53-role'
  zoneType: private

externalDNS:
  annotationFilter: "mydomain.com/external-dns=owned"
  domainFilterList:
  - web-app.mydomain.com
  namespaceFilter: 'web-app'
  registry:
    txtPrefix: 'webapp'
  sources:
  - ingress
  extraArgs:
  - "--zone-id-filter=Z262CGXUQ3M97"

provider: aws
```

Additionally to the above example, `external-dns` can also be configured to synchronize `DNSEndpoint` custom resources:

```yaml
# values.yaml
...
externalDNS:
  sources:
  - crd
...
```

Here is an example `DNSEndpoint` resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: externaldns.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: DNSEndpoint
metadata:
  name: my-record
  namespace: web-app
  annotations:
    mydomain.com/external-dns: owned
spec:
  endpoints:
  - dnsName: www.mydomain.com
    recordTTL: 60
    recordType: A
    targets:
    - 1.2.3.4
```

See our [full reference page on how to configure applications](https://docs.giantswarm.io/reference/app-configuration/) for more details.

## Compatibility

This app has been tested to work with the following workload cluster release versions:

* AWS `v13.0.0`
* Azure `v16.0.2`

## Limitations

Some apps have restrictions on how they can be deployed.
Not following these limitations will most likely result in a broken deployment.

External DNS v2.0.0+ requires
* Kubernetes version `1.19.0-0` or greater
* [nginx-ingress-controller-app v1.14.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1140---2021-02-03) or greater to work (due to the need for the filtering annotation).
  * If you do not (or cannot) upgrade `nginx-ingress-controller-app` to `v1.14.0`,
    you can work around this by running the following command to ensure the default
    `external-dns` continues to reconcile the relevant Service:

```bash
kubectl -n kube-system annotate service nginx-ingress-controller-app "giantswarm.io/external-dns=managed"
```

## Release Process

* Ensure CHANGELOG.md is up to date.
* Create a new branch to trigger the release workflow e.g. to release `v0.1.0`,
create a branch from master called `master#release#v0.1.0` and push it.
* This will push a new git tag and trigger a new tarball to be pushed to the
`default-catalog` and the `giantswarm-catalog`
